   <title>Update to alerting to normal users</title>
   <description>We have released an update to fix normal users receiving alerts with no ability to turn this off. An option is now available within the General alert settings section to
   enable this. Please note that the default is off to match with the other default contact settings. If you expect normal users to receive alerts then you should enable this new option.</description>
